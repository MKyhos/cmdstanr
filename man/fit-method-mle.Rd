\title{Extract point estimate after optimization}
\usage{
mle(variables = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{variables}{(character vector) The variables (parameters, transformed
parameters, and generated quantities) to include. If NULL (the default)
then all variables are included.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector. See \strong{Examples}.
}
\description{
The \verb{$mle()} method is only available for \code{\link{CmdStanMLE}}
objects. It returns the point estimate as a numeric vector with one element
per variable. The returned vector does \emph{not} include \code{lp__}, the total log
probability (\code{target}) accumulated in the model block of the Stan program,
which is available via the \code{\link[=fit-method-lp]{$lp()}} method and also
included in the \code{\link[=fit-method-draws]{$draws()}} method.

The name \code{mle} may be somewhat misleading because the \verb{$optimize()} method
can compute either a penalized maximum likelihood estimate or a maximum a
posteriori estimate, depending on the value of the \code{jacobian} argument when
the model is fit. Additionally, for models without constrained parameters,
the penalized MLE and the posterior mode are equivalent, as the Jacobian
adjustment has no effect.
