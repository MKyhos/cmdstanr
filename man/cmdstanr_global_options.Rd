\description{
These options can be set via \code{\link[=options]{options()}} for an entire \R session.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{cmdstanr_draws_format}: Which format provided by the \pkg{posterior}
package should be used when returning the posterior or approximate posterior
draws? The default depends on the model fitting method. See
\link[=fit-method-draws]{draws} for more details.
\item \code{cmdstanr_force_recompile}: Should the default be to recompile models
even if there were no Stan code changes since last compiled?  See
\link[=model-method-compile]{compile} for more details. The default is \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{cmdstanr_max_rows}: The maximum number of rows of output to print when
using the \code{\link[=fit-method-summary]{$print()}} method. The default is 10.
\item \code{cmdstanr_print_line_numbers}: Should line numbers be included when
printing a Stan program? The default is \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{cmdstanr_no_ver_check}: Should the check for a more recent version of
CmdStan be disabled? The default is \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{cmdstanr_output_dir}: The directory where CmdStan should write its output
CSV files when fitting models. The default is a temporary directory. Files in
a temporary directory are removed as part of \R garbage collection, while
files in an explicitly defined directory are not automatically deleted.
\item \code{cmdstanr_verbose}: Should more information be printed
when compiling or running models, including showing how CmdStan was called
internally? The default is \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{cmdstanr_warn_inits}: Should a warning be thrown if initial values are
only provided for a subset of parameters? The default is \code{TRUE}.
\item \code{cmdstanr_write_stan_file_dir}: The directory where \code{\link[=write_stan_file]{write_stan_file()}}
should write Stan files. The default is a temporary directory. Files in
a temporary directory are removed as part of \R garbage collection, while
files in an explicitly defined directory are not automatically deleted.
\item \code{mc.cores}: The number of cores to use for various parallelization tasks
(e.g. running MCMC chains, installing CmdStan). The default depends on the
use case and is documented with the methods that make use of \code{mc.cores}.
