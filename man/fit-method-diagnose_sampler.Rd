\title{Sampler diagnostic summaries and warnings}
\usage{
diagnose_sampler(
  diagnostics = c("divergences", "treedepth", "ebfmi"),
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{diagnostics}{(character vector) One or more diagnostics to check. The
currently supported diagnostics are \verb{"divergences}, \code{"treedepth"}, and
\verb{"ebfmi}.}

\item{quiet}{(logical) Should warning messages about the diagnostics be
suppressed? The default is \code{FALSE}, in which case warning messages are
printed in addition to returning the values of the diagnostics.}
}
\value{
A list with as many named elements as \code{diagnostics} selected. The
possible elements and their values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"num_divergent"}: A vector of the number of divergences per chain.
\item \code{"num_max_treedepth"}: A vector of the number of times \code{max_treedepth} was hit per chain.
\item \code{"ebfmi"}: A vector of E-BFMI values per chain.
}
}
\description{
Warnings and summaries of sampler diagnostics. To instead get
the underlying values of the sampler diagnostics for each iteration and
chain use the \code{\link[=fit-method-sampler_diagnostics]{$sampler_diagnostics()}}
method.

This method is similar to \code{\link[=fit-method-cmdstan_summary]{$cmdstan_diagnose()}}
but everything is done in \R (rather than calling CmdStan utilities) and
the summaries are returned as a list (not just printed).

Currently parameter-specific diagnostics like R-hat and effective sample
size are not handled by this method. Those diagnostics are provided via the
\code{\link[=fit-method-summary]{$summary()}} method.
